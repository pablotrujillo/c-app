# c-app

This project is a simple C application that demonstrates the use of CMake for building and managing the project.

## Project Structure
## Continuous Integration and Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD to ensure code quality and automate builds. The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### Key Features of the CI/CD Pipeline:
- **Build Validation**: Automatically builds the project using CMake to ensure there are no build errors.
- **Unit Testing**: Runs tests (if any) to validate the functionality of the application.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Ensures the code adheres to defined standards.

To view the CI/CD workflow, check the `.github/workflows` directory in the repository.
